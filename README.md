Hello, Github, my name is dimsail5750, and I am just a random guy testing how github works.

The sample change in the "message-and-package-edit" branch in changing the printed message from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, Github!", and removing the package declaration to the class location on my PC.

Over and out!
